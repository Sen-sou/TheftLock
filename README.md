# TheftLock
Anti-theft Android Application

Description:
TheftLock is a security-focused Android application developed as a final year project to help protect usersâ€™ mobile devices from theft. The app provides proactive and reactive features that monitor and respond to suspicious activity when the device is unattended or at risk of being stolen.

Current Implementation Features:

Bluetooth Out-of-range Alarm System: Triggers an alert when the device moves out of range from a paired Bluetooth device (e.g., smartwatch or another phone), indicating potential theft or separation.

Flashlight Indicator: Activates the flashlight to draw visual attention during unauthorized movement or disconnection.

Vibration Alert: Provides tactile feedback to quickly notify the user of a potential security breach.

Photo Capture: Automatically captures a photo every 60 seconds using the front camera, which can help identify a potential thief.
