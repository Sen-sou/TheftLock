# TheftLock
## Anti-theft Android Application

**Description**:
TheftLock is a security-focused Android application developed as a final year project to help protect usersâ€™ mobile devices from theft. The app provides proactive and reactive features that monitor and respond to suspicious activity when the device is unattended or at risk of being stolen.

**Current Implementation Features**:

_Bluetooth Out-of-range Alarm System_: Triggers an alert when the device moves out of range from a paired Bluetooth device (e.g., smartwatch or another phone), indicating potential theft or separation.

_Flashlight Indicator_: Activates the flashlight to draw visual attention during unauthorized movement or disconnection.

_Vibration Alert_: Provides tactile feedback to quickly notify the user of a potential security breach.

_Photo Capture_: Automatically captures a photo every 60 seconds using the front camera, which can help identify a potential thief.
